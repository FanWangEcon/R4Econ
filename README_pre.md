This is a work-in-progress [website](https://fanwangecon.github.io/R4Econ/) consisting of R panel data and optimization examples for Statistics/Econometrics/Economic Analysis.

> [**bookdown site**](https://fanwangecon.github.io/R4Econ/bookdown) and [**bookdown pdf**](https://fanwangecon.github.io/R4Econ/bookdown/Panel-Data-and-Optimization-with-R.pdf).

Materials gathered from various [projects](https://fanwangecon.github.io/research) in which R code is used. Files are from the [R4Econ](https://github.com/FanWangEcon/R4Econ) repository. This is not a R package, but a list of examples in PDF/HTML/Rmd formats. [REconTools](https://fanwangecon.github.io/REconTools/) is a package that can be installed with tools used in [projects](https://fanwangecon.github.io/research) involving R.

Bullet points show which [base R](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.5.2), [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) or other functions/commands are used to achieve various objectives. An effort is made to use only [base R](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.5.2) and [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages whenever possible to reduce dependencies. The goal of this repository is to make it easier to find/re-use codes produced for various projects.
