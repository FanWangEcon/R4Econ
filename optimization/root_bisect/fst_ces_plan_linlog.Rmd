# Outline

Generic Vectorized Bisection Structure.

There is a function, solve for root for that function. Concurrently across an array of inputs.

Specifically, we have: g(a,x) = 0, solve for x, given different a values. a could be a matrix.

In the code below. First test bisection given loglin optimal choice function using loop.

Then test the same code, vectorized.

Then test the same code, vectorized and as a part of an anonymous function.
